Long story short, [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) (like [Astro](https://astro.build)) provides a powerful static site generation (SSG) feature that allows developers to pre-render pages at build time.

## Benefits of Nuxt SSG

1. **Single Page Application (SPA) makes route switching fast**: Nuxt's SSG mode generates a SPA, which means that once the initial HTML is loaded, subsequent navigations are handled client-side, resulting in faster route transitions.

2. **Sharing state makes transition animations possible**: Since Nuxt can share state across different pages, it allows for smooth transition animations, enhancing the user experience.

3. **Automatic code splitting**: Nuxt automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, which are loaded on demand, improving the initial load time and overall performance.*

4. **SEO-friendly**: Pre-rendered HTML ensures that search engines can easily crawl and index your content, improving your site's SEO.

5. **Static hosting**: Generated static files can be hosted on any static hosting service, reducing hosting costs and improving scalability.

6. **Built-in support for Vue.js**: Nuxt is built on top of Vue.js, providing a rich ecosystem and a familiar development experience for Vue developers.

7. **Extensive plugin ecosystem**: Nuxt has a wide range of plugins and modules that can be easily integrated to extend the functionality of your static site.

8. **Automatic routing**: Nuxt automatically generates routes based on the file structure, simplifying the development process and reducing the need for manual configuration.

## Where Astro falls behind

Astro meets most of the conditions mentioned above, such as automatic code splitting, SEO-friendly pre-rendered HTML, static hosting, and an extensive plugin ecosystem. However, Astro does not maintain state between routes, which means that transition animations are not possible. This also results in slower route transitions compared to Nuxt's Single Page Application (SPA) approach.

In all ssg content heavy workloads, Astro is good enough and is probably easier one to work with. But if you are looking for a more polished and feature-rich SSG, Nuxt might be the way to go.
